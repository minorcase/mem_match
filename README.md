Memory match might be my favorite project that I've worked on so far. I really enjoyed building this game, it was my first introduction to object oriented Javascript and it also gave me an excuse to incorporate one of my favorite game series, Final Fantasy.

If I could do this over again, there are a few things I would do differently.

    • I would change how the players stats are displayed.
    • I would add more in-depth statistics like # of attack pairs matched, # of defense pairs mac, etc.
    • Add better volume control.
    • Add a final mechanic for the Titan boss and a real game over screen.
